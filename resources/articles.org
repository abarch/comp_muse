**  hugging face diffusers
- https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
- Diffusers is the go-to library for state-of-the-art pretrained
  diffusion models for generating images, audio, and even 3D
  structures of molecules.

** audio-diffusion-pytorch (ETH + max-planck) 
- https://github.com/archinetai/audio-diffusion-pytorch
-  A fully featured audio diffusion library, for PyTorch. Includes
  models for unconditional audio generation, text-conditional audio
  generation, diffusion autoencoding, upsampling, and vocoding. The
  provided models are waveform-based, however, the U-Net (built using
  a-unet), DiffusionModel, diffusion method, and diffusion samplers
  are both generic to any dimension and highly customizable to work on
  other formats. Note: no pre-trained models are provided here, this
  library is meant for research purposes.

** Diffusion-LM Improves Controllable Text Generation 
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14217.pdf
- Controlling the behavior of language models (LMs) without
  re-training is a major open problem in natural language
  generation. While recent works have demon- strated successes on
  controlling simple sentence attributes (e.g., sentiment), there has
  been little progress on complex, fine-grained controls (e.g.,
  syntactic structure).  To address this challenge, we develop a new
  non-autoregressive language model based on continuous diffusions
  that we call Diffusion-LM. Building upon the recent successes of
  diffusion models in continuous domains, Diffusion-LM iteratively
  denoises a sequence of Gaussian vectors into word vectors, yielding
  a sequence of intermediate latent variables. The continuous,
  hierarchical nature of these inter- mediate variables enables a
  simple gradient-based
 algorithm to perform complex, controllable generation tasks. We
 demonstrate successful control of Diffusion-LM for six challenging
 fine-grained control tasks, significantly outperforming prior work.

** Symbolic music generation conditioned on continuous-valued emotions
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16165.pdf
- In this paper we present a new approach for the generation of multi-instrument symbolic
 music driven by musical emotion. The principal novelty of our approach centres on conditioning a state-
 of-the-art transformer based on continuous-valued valence and arousal labels. In addition, we provide a
 new large-scale dataset of symbolic music paired with emotion labels in terms of valence and arousal. We
 evaluate our approach in a quantitative manner in two ways, first by measuring its note prediction accuracy,
 and second via a regression task in the valence-arousal plane. Our results demonstrate that our proposed
 approaches outperform conditioning using control tokens which is representative of the current state of the
 art

**  Noise2Music: Text-conditioned Music Generation with Diffusion Models
-  https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03917
- https://google-research.github.io/noise2music/

- We introduce Noise2Music, where a series of diffusion models is
  trained to generate high-quality 30-second music clips from text
  prompts. Two types of diffusion models, a generator model, which
  generates an intermediate representation conditioned on text, and a
  cascader model, which generates high-fidelity audio conditioned on
  the intermediate representation and possibly the text, are trained
  and utilized in succession to generate high-fidelity music. We
  explore two options for the intermediate representation, one using a
  spectrogram and the other using audio with lower fidelity. We find
  that the generated audio is not only able to faithfully reflect key
  elements of the text prompt such as genre, tempo, instruments, mood,
  and era, but goes beyond to ground fine-grained semantics of the
  prompt. Pretrained large language models play a key role in this
  story -- they are used to generate paired text for the audio of the
  training set and to extract embeddings of the text prompts ingested
  by the diffusion models.

** DANCE2MIDI: DANCE-DRIVEN MULTI-INSTRUMENTS MUSIC GENERATION

-  https://www.catalyzex.com/paper/arxiv:2301.09080
- Dance-driven music generation aims to generate musical pieces
  conditioned on dance videos. Previous works focus on monophonic or
  raw audio generation, while the multi- instruments scenario is
  under-explored. The challenges of the dance-driven multi-instruments
  music (MIDI) genera- tion are two-fold: 1) no publicly available
  multi-instruments MIDI and video paired dataset and 2) the weak
  correla- tion between music and video. To tackle these challenges,
  we build the first multi-instruments MIDI and dance paired dataset
  (D2MIDI). Based on our proposed dataset, we in- troduce a
  multi-instruments MIDI generation framework (Dance2MIDI) conditioned
  on dance video. Specifically, 1) to model the correlation between
  music and dance, we encode the dance motion using the GCN, and 2) to
  generate harmo- nious and coherent music, we employ Transformer to
  decode the MIDI sequence. We evaluate the generated music of our
  framework trained on D2MIDI dataset and demonstrate that our method
  outperforms existing methods. The data and code are available on
  https://github.com/Dance2MIDI/Dance2MIDI
