- https://openreview.net/pdf/4ee95daea73cb05d2ea8780258b25684ccd82a88.pdf (more recent)

- Recent symbolic music generative models have achieved significant improvements
in the quality of the generated samples. Nevertheless, it remains hard for users
to control the output in such a way that it matches their expectation. To address
this limitation, high-level, human-interpretable conditioning is essential. In this
work, we release FIGARO, a Transformer-based conditional model trained to
generate symbolic music based on a sequence of high-level control codes. To this
end, we propose description-to-sequence learning, which consists of automatically
extracting fine-grained, human-interpretable features (the description) and training
a sequence-to-sequence model to reconstruct the original sequence given only the
description as input. FIGARO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-track
symbolic music generation both in terms of style transfer and sample quality. We
show that performance can be further improved by combining human-interpretable
with learned features. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that FIGARO is
able to generate samples that closely adhere to the content of the input descriptions,
even when they deviate significantly from the training distribution

** Diffusion-LM Improves Controllable Text Generation 
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14217.pdf
- Controlling the behavior of language models (LMs) without
  re-training is a major open problem in natural language
  generation. While recent works have demon- strated successes on
  controlling simple sentence attributes (e.g., sentiment), there has
  been little progress on complex, fine-grained controls (e.g.,
  syntactic structure).  To address this challenge, we develop a new
  non-autoregressive language model based on continuous diffusions
  that we call Diffusion-LM. Building upon the recent successes of
  diffusion models in continuous domains, Diffusion-LM iteratively
  denoises a sequence of Gaussian vectors into word vectors, yielding
  a sequence of intermediate latent variables. The continuous,
  hierarchical nature of these inter- mediate variables enables a
  simple gradient-based
 algorithm to perform complex, controllable generation tasks. We
 demonstrate successful control of Diffusion-LM for six challenging
 fine-grained control tasks, significantly outperforming prior work.

** Symbolic music generation conditioned on continuous-valued emotions
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16165.pdf
- In this paper we present a new approach for the generation of multi-instrument symbolic
 music driven by musical emotion. The principal novelty of our approach centres on conditioning a state-
 of-the-art transformer based on continuous-valued valence and arousal labels. In addition, we provide a
 new large-scale dataset of symbolic music paired with emotion labels in terms of valence and arousal. We
 evaluate our approach in a quantitative manner in two ways, first by measuring its note prediction accuracy,
 and second via a regression task in the valence-arousal plane. Our results demonstrate that our proposed
 approaches outperform conditioning using control tokens which is representative of the current state of the
 art

**  Noise2Music: Text-conditioned Music Generation with Diffusion Models
-  https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03917
- https://google-research.github.io/noise2music/

- We introduce Noise2Music, where a series of diffusion models is
  trained to generate high-quality 30-second music clips from text
  prompts. Two types of diffusion models, a generator model, which
  generates an intermediate representation conditioned on text, and a
  cascader model, which generates high-fidelity audio conditioned on
  the intermediate representation and possibly the text, are trained
  and utilized in succession to generate high-fidelity music. We
  explore two options for the intermediate representation, one using a
  spectrogram and the other using audio with lower fidelity. We find
  that the generated audio is not only able to faithfully reflect key
  elements of the text prompt such as genre, tempo, instruments, mood,
  and era, but goes beyond to ground fine-grained semantics of the
  prompt. Pretrained large language models play a key role in this
  story -- they are used to generate paired text for the audio of the
  training set and to extract embeddings of the text prompts ingested
  by the diffusion models.

** DANCE2MIDI: DANCE-DRIVEN MULTI-INSTRUMENTS MUSIC GENERATION

-  https://www.catalyzex.com/paper/arxiv:2301.09080
- Dance-driven music generation aims to generate musical pieces
  conditioned on dance videos. Previous works focus on monophonic or
  raw audio generation, while the multi- instruments scenario is
  under-explored. The challenges of the dance-driven multi-instruments
  music (MIDI) genera- tion are two-fold: 1) no publicly available
  multi-instruments MIDI and video paired dataset and 2) the weak
  correla- tion between music and video. To tackle these challenges,
  we build the first multi-instruments MIDI and dance paired dataset
  (D2MIDI). Based on our proposed dataset, we in- troduce a
  multi-instruments MIDI generation framework (Dance2MIDI) conditioned
  on dance video. Specifically, 1) to model the correlation between
  music and dance, we encode the dance motion using the GCN, and 2) to
  generate harmo- nious and coherent music, we employ Transformer to
  decode the MIDI sequence. We evaluate the generated music of our
  framework trained on D2MIDI dataset and demonstrate that our method
  outperforms existing methods. The data and code are available on
  https://github.com/Dance2MIDI/Dance2MIDI

** Generating Lead Sheets with Affect: A Novel Conditional seq2seq Framework
The authors proposed a novel approach to generate lead sheets (melody with cord progression) from scratch which are conditioned on musical valence, phrasing and time signature. They took inspiration from the Neural Machine Translation problem and made use of the sequence to sequence framework to translate a sequence of high-level musical parameters (conditions) to a lead sheet. A user can define high-level features (valence, phrasing and time signature) as well as a "low-level" event density called event density which describes the number of events in a bar.

** MusicLM: Generating Music From Text
MusicLM is a generative model that produces high-quality music consistent over several minutes conditioned on text sequence with additional conditional input possible such as melody or image. It uses three independent pretrained models to generate latent representations for audio and text and to calculate coherence between audio and text embeddings. The generation of music is described as a hierarchical sequence-to-sequence modeling task, with a semantic modeling stage to process conditioning signals and an acoustic modeling stage to translate both conditioning tokens and semantic tokesn to audio.

** Music SketchNet: Controllable Music Generation via Factorized Representations of Pitch and Rhythm
Music SketchNet is a neural network framework for automatic music generation guided by partial musical ideas from a user. The model is designed to fill in missing part based on known past and future context and "user specification" in form of text input. It uses SketchVAE, a novel variational autoencoder that explicitly factorizes rhythm and pitch contour, to encode and decode the music between external music measures and learned factorized latent representatations. The authors further introduced SketchInpainter, which predicts musical ideas in the form of latent variables and SketchConnector which combines the output from SketchInpainter and the user's sketching. The output of SketchConnector is then decoded by SketchVAE to generate music.
