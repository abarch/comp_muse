To use the "getGyro.py" you need following libraries:
- bleak
- async

To collect data you just need to connect the Arduino via Bluetooth and then to start the script.
The script looks automatically for the Arduino and connects with it. Then it prints the Gyroscope data for 10 seconds.
If you want to get endless data you just need to start the script with the parameter endless (e.g. "python getGyro.py endless").
